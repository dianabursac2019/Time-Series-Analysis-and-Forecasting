ARIMA and Regression models

Air pollution occurs when any harmful gases, dust, smoke enters into the atmosphere and makes it difficult for plants, animals, and humans to survive 
as the air becomes dirty. There are several causes of air pollution, among those the increase in car usage positively correlates with the increase in the level of 
pollutants emitted into the air, leading to a higher level of pollution. 
This paper aims to explore different time series models in predicting the two main pollutants PM10 and O3 in the city of Madrid. 
Specifically, we studied the impact of Auto regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models, seasonal models (SARIMA) and regression models. 
We were able to see how different models and different combinations of variables in the regression model impact trend and volatility in the forecast process. 
Particularly, we explored the impact of the third pollutant NO2 on PM10 concentration. In this paper we covered some basic concepts in time series analysis 
such as stationarity and autocorrelation functions. We discussed different methods for checking the residuals’ independence and normality.
Our results show that the regression model with trend and season achieved the best PM10 forecast results on the test data. 
However, PM10 fluctuations were better predicted by adding additional variables such as NO2. 
We could also see that better RMSE and MAPE were achieved with regression models than with ARIMA, although the residuals behavior was improved by ARIMA. 
There is a decreasing trend in PM10 pollution in Madrid, and this is directly related to the shift from fossil fuels to sustainable energy sources after 2012. 
The models can be used to assist Madrid’s authority and communities in improving the air quality, whether it is by reducing the car usage, 
by urban planning, or shifting from fossil fuels to sustainable energy sources.
